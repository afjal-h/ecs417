    <h2 class="">Skills & Achievments</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>I like to think of myself as a leader when it comes to groupwork, I'm very easy
    to work with and have confidence presenting in front of others. I'm open-minded and always listen to others ideas.
  I ran as head boy in secondary school as well as prefect in sixth form, so I can handle responsibility. While in sixth form
I was nominated by all sixth form teachers to get the Jack Petchey award.</p>

      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <hr>
      <p><strong>Clyde and Co. - 2018 </strong>Work experience at Clyde and Co. law firm in Aldgate.
        I was shadowing a couple of teams in the IT department. I learnt how teams work together in big projects and
        how they organize tasks. From this experience, my teamwork skills have improved from observing how a small group
        of people work together, as well as my presentation skills.
        We had to present in a group about an idea to reduce waste in offices to a group of roughly 50 people.
        This vastly improved my public speaking skills as well as my preparation skills.
